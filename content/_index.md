I’m a Business Intelligence Manager living in Berlin, Germany – originally from Manisa, Turkey, which is world-famous for its sultana grapes.

Currently, I’m working at [We Are Era](https://www.weareera.com/), which is part of an RTL Group, and Bertelsmann, and I lead the Business Intelligence team, tasked with writing our very own data success stories. Before that, I was working as a data analyst on the Inventory Intelligence team at [Idealo internet GmbH](https://www.idealo.de/), supporting our business teams by providing data-driven analyses and research. R is my dominant language professionally. While I’m doing statistical analysis and modeling data with R and Python, I find Tableau to be the best tool for data visualization because it is easy to use and rich with useful features.

My bachelor’s degree is in economics from the [University of Ege](https://ege.edu.tr/), and I also studied data science and management (Master of Science) at the [Leuphana University](https://www.leuphana.de/) in Lüneburg.

I’m always eager to learn, and after I fell in love with data and design thinking, I plan to mostly blog about data-related topics (e.g., visualization, statistics, machine learning) and design topics (e.g., use cases, ideation methods, creative thinking). My ultimate goal is to share what I’ve learned and give insights into what I’m currently involved in.

My other non-data-related interests are project management, behavioral science, politics, history, basketball, travel, podcasts, poetry, and sci-fi. All of which I plan to blog about at some point.
