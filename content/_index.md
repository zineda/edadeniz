I’m a Head of Data living in Berlin, Germany – originally from Manisa, Turkey, which is world-famous for its sultana grapes.

Currently, I work at [We Are Era](https://www.weareera.com/), part of an RTL Group, and Bertelsmann, where I lead the Data and Product teams, tasked with writing our very own data and AI success stories by developing scalable data and AI-driven products. Before that, I was working as a data analyst on the Inventory Intelligence team at [Idealo internet GmbH](https://www.idealo.de/), supporting our business teams by providing data-driven analyses and research. R is my dominant language professionally. While I’m doing statistical analysis and modeling data with R and Python, I find Tableau to be the best tool for data visualization because it is easy to use and rich with useful features.

My bachelor’s degree is in economics from the [University of Ege](https://ege.edu.tr/), and I also studied data science and management (Master of Science) at the [Leuphana University](https://www.leuphana.de/) in Lüneburg.

I’m always eager to learn, and my passion lies at the intersection of AI, data, and product development. I plan to blog primarily about AI-driven innovations, data strategies, and product-led growth—exploring topics such as machine learning, data visualization, statistical modeling, and creative problem-solving through ideation methods. My ultimate goal is to share what I’ve learned and give insights into what I’m currently involved in.

My other non-data-related interests are behavioral science, politics, history, basketball, travel, podcasts, poetry, and sci-fi. All of which I plan to blog about at some point.
